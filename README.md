# Amazon Rekognition Image Analysis Demo

## üìå What It Does
This project uses **Amazon Rekognition** to analyze an image stored in **Amazon S3** and detect labels (objects, scenes, and concepts) within it.  
It demonstrates how AWS Rekognition can be used for computer vision tasks like image classification, moderation, and facial recognition.

---

## üõ† How I Built It
1. Uploaded an image to an **Amazon S3** bucket.
2. Wrote a **Python script** using the **Boto3 AWS SDK** to:
   - Connect to Amazon S3.
   - Call the Rekognition `detect_labels` API.
   - Print out detected labels with confidence scores.
3. Ran the script locally to test the detection.

## ‚ö° Challenges I Solved
- Learned how to configure AWS credentials (Access Key & Secret Key) securely.
- Understood how Rekognition expects input from S3 rather than a local file.
- Managed IAM permissions so the script could access both S3 and Rekognition.

## ‚òÅ AWS Services Used & Why
- **Amazon Rekognition** ‚Üí For AI-powered image analysis and label detection.
- **Amazon S3** ‚Üí To store the image and make it accessible to Rekognition.
- **AWS IAM** ‚Üí To create secure credentials and manage service permissions.
